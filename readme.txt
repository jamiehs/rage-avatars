Replace your avatar-less users Gravatars with rage comic avatars such as those popular on Reddit.

== Description ==

This plugin will replace all of the default avatars on your blog with rage comic faces.

More specifically, it passes the rage faces as the default argument when the request for the user's Gravatar is made.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `rage-avatars` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this break anything =

Maybe. I have tried to make the plugin only touch Gravatrs though, so you should be fine.

= Can I assign specific avatars to users? =

Nope, embrace the random!

= Can I use my own images? (I see an avatars folder in there) =

Yes, but be warned that updating the plugin will delete your custom images. There are future plans to provide a custom images folder outside of the plugin folder however.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is what it looks like when the plugin is activated.
2. Here is the plugin on a more populated blog. Notice that the images are transparent and Chris Hopf's avatar is consistent with his entries even though that avatar is randomly assigned. Michael Barber has a Gravatar so his was left untouched.

== Changelog ==

== Inspiration ==

The plugin was inspired by the hilarious comics found here: [Reddit Rage Comics](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu "fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu")
